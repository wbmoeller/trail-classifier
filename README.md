# trail-classifier
Using Gemini to train an AI model to classify the difficulty of hiking trails

# Initial prompt
I would like to build a ML model using some of these tools and python. It will use open source training data (that i want you to find) in order to classify the difficulty of hiking trails

# Gemini "Plan"
Here's a plan for building your hiking trail difficulty classification model using the tools you mentioned and Python, along with some potential sources for open-source training data:

Project Outline:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
  - Identify Open-Source Data:
    Several potential sources exist:
    - Hiking Websites and Apps: Many hiking websites and apps like AllTrails or Hiking Project have open APIs or downloadable data dumps that include trail information (length, elevation gain, user ratings).
    - Government Datasets: Organizations like the US Forest Service or National Park Service sometimes release trail data.
    - OpenStreetMap (OSM): OSM contains a wealth of geographic data, including hiking trails, that you can extract using tools like Overpass Turbo.
  - Preprocessing:
    - Use Pandas to clean and organize the data.
    - Standardize difficulty labels (e.g., "easy," "moderate," "difficult").
    - Extract features:
      - Numerical: Length, elevation gain, average grade
      - Categorical: Trail type (loop, out-and-back), terrain type
      - Text: Trail descriptions (we'll use NLP later)
2. Feature Engineering:
  - Text Features (OpenNLP or spaCy):
    - Tokenize and clean trail descriptions.
    - Extract keywords related to difficulty (e.g., "steep," "rocky," "exposed").
    - Create features like:
      - Number of difficulty-related keywords
      - Sentiment analysis of descriptions
  - Combine Features: Create a final feature set by merging numerical, categorical, and text-based features.
3. Model Training:
  - Choice of Algorithm:
    - Classification: Given that difficulty is likely to have discrete levels (easy, moderate, difficult), you'll use classification algorithms.
    - Options:
      - Logistic Regression (simple, interpretable)
      - Random Forest (powerful, handles complex relationships)
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - Naive Bayes (fast, good for text data)
    - Implementation (scikit-learn):
      - Split data into training and testing sets.
      - Train multiple models and evaluate their performance on the test set.
4. Model Evaluation and Selection:
  - Metrics:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision, Recall, F1-score (especially if class imbalance exists)
  - Select: Choose the model with the best performance on the test set.
  - Fine-tuning: Adjust hyperparameters for optimal results.
5. Deployment (Optional):
  - API: Create a web API using Flask or FastAPI to allow others to use your model.
  - Integration: Integrate your model into a hiking app or website.

Example Code Snippet (scikit-learn):
```
Python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# ... (Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps) ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
```Use code with caution.```

Important Considerations:

- Data Quality: The success of your model heavily depends on the quality and quantity of your training data. Ensure it's representative of various trail types and difficulty levels.
- Ethical Considerations: Be mindful of potential biases in trail descriptions or user ratings that could impact your model.
- Model Interpretability: Consider using techniques like SHAP values to understand how your model makes decisions, which can be important for user trust.

    (33.4475,-118.3022,34.4635,-116.4345);
);

## Analysis
The results you're seeing indicate that all three of your models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) are achieving perfect accuracy (1.00) on your testing data. This means they are correctly predicting the difficulty level (sac_scale) for every single trail in your test set.

The classification report further confirms this, showing:

- Precision: 1.00 for all classes, meaning that when a model predicts a certain difficulty level, it's always correct.
- Recall: 1.00 for all classes except one in the Random Forest model. This means that the models are able to find all the instances of each difficulty level in the test set. The one exception is the Random Forest model for sac_scale 2.0, which has a recall of 0.99, meaning it missed one instance of this class.
- F1-score: 1.00 for all classes, indicating a perfect balance between precision and recall.

What this means:

On the surface, this seems fantastic! Your models are performing exceptionally well on your test data. However, it's essential to be cautious and consider a few things:

Potential Issues:

1. Overfitting: It's possible that your models are overfitting to your training data. This means they have memorized the training examples so well that they perform perfectly on data they've already seen (the training set) but might not generalize well to new, unseen trails.

2. Data Leakage: There could be data leakage, where information from the target variable (sac_scale) is inadvertently included in your features, leading to artificially high performance. Double-check your feature engineering process to ensure this isn't happening.

3. Small or Unrepresentative Test Set: If your test set is too small or not representative of the overall trail population, the perfect accuracy might not reflect real-world performance.

Next Steps:

1. Evaluate on New Data: The best way to assess if your model is overfitting is to evaluate it on a completely new dataset that it hasn't seen during training. If performance drops significantly, it's a sign of overfitting.

2. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation techniques (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to get a more robust estimate of your model's performance. This involves splitting your data into multiple folds, training on some and testing on others, and averaging the results.

3. Simplify Your Models: If you suspect overfitting, try simplifying your models (e.g., reduce the number of features, use regularization techniques) or gather more diverse training data.

4. Investigate Data Leakage: Carefully review your feature engineering process to ensure no information from the target variable is leaking into your features.

5. Consider Other Metrics:  While accuracy is a good starting point, it's not always the best metric, especially if your classes are imbalanced. Explore other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to get a deeper understanding of your model's performance.

Remember, perfect accuracy is rare in real-world machine learning scenarios.  It's essential to be critical of your results and ensure that your models are genuinely learning meaningful patterns rather than memorizing the training data.
