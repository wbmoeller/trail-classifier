# trail-classifier
Using Gemini to train an AI model to classify the difficulty of hiking trails

# Initial prompt
I would like to build a ML model using some of these tools and python. It will use open source training data (that i want you to find) in order to classify the difficulty of hiking trails

# Gemini "Plan"
Here's a plan for building your hiking trail difficulty classification model using the tools you mentioned and Python, along with some potential sources for open-source training data:

Project Outline:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
  - Identify Open-Source Data:
    Several potential sources exist:
    - Hiking Websites and Apps: Many hiking websites and apps like AllTrails or Hiking Project have open APIs or downloadable data dumps that include trail information (length, elevation gain, user ratings).
    - Government Datasets: Organizations like the US Forest Service or National Park Service sometimes release trail data.
    - OpenStreetMap (OSM): OSM contains a wealth of geographic data, including hiking trails, that you can extract using tools like Overpass Turbo.
  - Preprocessing:
    - Use Pandas to clean and organize the data.
    - Standardize difficulty labels (e.g., "easy," "moderate," "difficult").
    - Extract features:
      - Numerical: Length, elevation gain, average grade
      - Categorical: Trail type (loop, out-and-back), terrain type
      - Text: Trail descriptions (we'll use NLP later)
2. Feature Engineering:
  - Text Features (OpenNLP or spaCy):
    - Tokenize and clean trail descriptions.
    - Extract keywords related to difficulty (e.g., "steep," "rocky," "exposed").
    - Create features like:
      - Number of difficulty-related keywords
      - Sentiment analysis of descriptions
  - Combine Features: Create a final feature set by merging numerical, categorical, and text-based features.
3. Model Training:
  - Choice of Algorithm:
    - Classification: Given that difficulty is likely to have discrete levels (easy, moderate, difficult), you'll use classification algorithms.
    - Options:
      - Logistic Regression (simple, interpretable)
      - Random Forest (powerful, handles complex relationships)
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - Naive Bayes (fast, good for text data)
    - Implementation (scikit-learn):
      - Split data into training and testing sets.
      - Train multiple models and evaluate their performance on the test set.
4. Model Evaluation and Selection:
  - Metrics:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision, Recall, F1-score (especially if class imbalance exists)
  - Select: Choose the model with the best performance on the test set.
  - Fine-tuning: Adjust hyperparameters for optimal results.
5. Deployment (Optional):
  - API: Create a web API using Flask or FastAPI to allow others to use your model.
  - Integration: Integrate your model into a hiking app or website.

Example Code Snippet (scikit-learn):
```
Python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# ... (Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps) ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
```Use code with caution.```

Important Considerations:

- Data Quality: The success of your model heavily depends on the quality and quantity of your training data. Ensure it's representative of various trail types and difficulty levels.
- Ethical Considerations: Be mindful of potential biases in trail descriptions or user ratings that could impact your model.
- Model Interpretability: Consider using techniques like SHAP values to understand how your model makes decisions, which can be important for user trust.
